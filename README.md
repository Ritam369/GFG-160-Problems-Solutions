# 🌟 **GFG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving** 🌟  

Welcome to my **GFG 160 Days of Problem Solving** repository! 🚀  
This repo contains my solutions to the problems from the **160 Days of Problem Solving** initiative by [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org).


## 📖 **About the Initiative** 
 
The **GFG 160** is a structured program designed to help programmers develop problem-solving skills, focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Every day, a new problem is assigned, covering various concepts like arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic programming, and more!  


## 📚 **Contents of this Repository**  
- **Solutions**: Each problem has its solution written in a structured, beginner-friendly, and efficient manner.  
- **Topics Covered**: Arrays, Strings, Searching & Sorting, and more advanced topics to come!  
- **Languages Used**: Solutions are primarily in **Java** or **C++**, depending on the context.  


## 🛠️ **Features**  
1. **Day-wise Solutions**: Problems are organized by day to maintain a logical flow.  
2. **Optimized Code**: Wherever possible, solutions are implemented with optimal time and space complexity.  
3. **Explanations**: Solutions are supplemented with comments and step-by-step breakdowns.
